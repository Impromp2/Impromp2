# Impromptu

Impromptu is all about spontenaity for the users, who have a couple hours and want to find something of interest.

**Finding an event**
A user has the ability to see all events that match their interests but ONLY during times that they are available. This is done by having the user create time slots when they are "normally free" on each day of the week. This schedule is then duplicated every week. Imromptu gives that specific user events at the beginning of each week. A user can also do custome searches if they suddenly find themselves having some available time during the week, eliminating the need for the user to go in and change their settings.

**Want to host an event?**
Since every user has their "normally free" times included in their profiles, someone who is looking to host an event can see when users (who will remain anonymous), that are interested in their topic, are free. These statistics allow the host to create their event at the most optimal time for the potential guests in the area. The host can also send out an email to all anonymous users as well, informing them of the event and why they should go.
